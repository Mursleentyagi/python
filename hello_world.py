print("Hello Python world!")

# When you run this code, you should see this output:
# Hello Python world!

"""When you run the file hello_world.py, the ending .py indicates that 
the file is a Python program. Your editor then runs the file through the 
Python interpreter, which reads through the program and determines what 
each word in the program means. For example, when the interpreter sees 
the word print, it prints to the screen whatever is inside the parentheses."""
